Wi-Fi Modem Placement Optimization
This project uses a hill-climbing algorithm with random restarts to optimize the placement of M Wi-Fi modems on an X×Y grid, minimizing the total Manhattan distance from N computers to their nearest Wi-Fi modem.
Problem Description

Goal: Position M Wi-Fi modems on an X×Y grid to minimize the sum of Manhattan distances from each of N computers to the nearest Wi-Fi.
Representation: Wi-Fi modems and computers are defined by unique (x, y) coordinates on the grid.
Objective Function: Computes the sum of Manhattan distances from each computer to its closest Wi-Fi, returning a negative value for maximization.

Algorithm Details

Hill-Climbing:
Starts with a random Wi-Fi layout.
Iteratively moves to the best neighboring configuration (lowest total distance) until no improvement is possible.
Neighbors are generated by moving one Wi-Fi modem in one of four directions (up, down, left, right).


Random Restarts:
Performs K retries (10-15) with different random starting layouts.
Keeps the best solution across all retries.


Optimizations:
Neighbor generation limited to four directions to reduce computation.
Maximum iterations per run capped at 500 for faster execution.
Restarts limited to 10-15 for efficiency.
Simplified layout generation using sets.
List comprehension improves computational performance.


Visualization:
Displays computers (P) and Wi-Fi modems (W) on the grid.
Shows lines connecting each computer to its nearest Wi-Fi.



Performance

10×10 Grid, 5 Computers, 2 Wi-Fi:
Average distance: ~2-3.
Runtime: 3-5 seconds.


12×12 Grid, 8 Computers, 3 Wi-Fi:
Average distance: ~3-4.
Runtime: 5-10 seconds.



Parameter Sensitivity

Number of Restarts (10-15):
Low (5): Reduces solution quality.
High (20): Increases runtime.


Iterations per Run (500):
Low (200): Limits search depth.
High (1000): Slows execution.


Grid Size (8-12):
Large (>15): Significantly increases computation time.



Pros and Cons

Pros:
Fast and simple for small to medium grids.
Efficient for typical use cases.
Random restarts improve solution quality.


Cons:
No guarantee of global optimum.
Slow for large grids.
Limited reachability due to constrained restarts.



Complexity

Time: O(num_computers * num_wifi * max_iterations * num_restarts).
10×10 grid: 3-5 seconds.
12×12 grid: 5-10 seconds.


Space: O(grid_size^2).

Resource Usage

Moderate for small to medium grids (8×8 to 12×12).
